    Technology Report: Huawei P20 Pro

  <body>
    The Huawei is the newest flagship phone under the Huawei brand and it has some amazing new features. It has a 3 camera setup with 40 megapixels. It also includes 6gb of ram with an octa core 2.4 Ghz CPU and a 1080x2244 resoloution. It also includes 128gb storage with a 4000mah battery and all of this for about the same price as the iPhone X(CAD$1250). Its speculated release date is April 8th 2018. The target audience for the phone is highend because of the steep price tag and all of the extra and features.I personally believe that this phone will be successful because it does introduce many new design features and aspects no other phone has.
